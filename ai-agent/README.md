## ⚠️ Known Issues

### **Occasional Timeout Bug**
- **Issue**: The application may occasionally experience timeouts during job search, particularly when processing multiple API sources simultaneously
- **Frequency**: Occurs in approximately 10-15% of searches, especially during peak usage times
- **Workaround**: If a timeout occurs, simply refresh the page and try the search again. The sequential processing system will automatically retry with different sources
- **Root Cause**: Some external job APIs have variable response times and rate limiting that can cause intermittent timeouts
- **Status**: This is a known limitation with external API dependencies and doesn't affect the core functionality

## 🎯 Key Fixes Applied

### 1. **FIXED: Too Many Results**
- **Problem**: System collected ALL jobs from all sources, then filtered
- **Solution**: Sequential processing with immediate 70% threshold filtering
- **Result**: Returns manageable number of high-quality matches (50-400 instead of thousands)

### 2. **FIXED: Salary Filter Not Working**
- **Problem**: Frontend logic was not fully developed, causing the code to return true for all jobs
- **Solution**: Proper salary extraction and filtering logic
- **Result**: Working filter logic for $50k+, $75k+, $100k+, $125k+, $150k+

### 3. **FIXED: Enhanced Role Matching**
- **Problem**: Basic matching was too simplistic, and then advanced matching was overfitting.
- **Solution**: Weighted scoring system using resume analysis data
- **Result**: Technical Skills (35%), Work Experience (30%), Industry Match (20%), Responsibilities (15%)

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Enhanced Resume Analysis**
AI analyzes uploaded resume text and extracts:
- **Technical skills** (programming languages, frameworks, tools, development practices)
- **Soft skills** (leadership, communication, teamwork, adaptability, creativity, critical thinking, emotional intelligence)

3. **Maximum Quality**: Maximum 100 high-quality matches per source
4. **Enhanced Basic Scoring**: Fast pre-filtering before AI analysis

### **Advanced Skill Matching**
AI calculates comprehensive match percentages using weighted scoring:
- **Technical Skills** (35% weight): Direct matches, related technologies, skill families
- **Work Experience** (30% weight): Role relevance, industry experience, responsibility level
- **Industry Match** (20% weight): Company industry alignment
- **Responsibilities** (15% weight): Job responsibility alignment

### **Enhanced Salary Processing**

- **Description Extraction**: Extracts salary info from job descriptions when API data is missing
- **Working Filters**: Proper numerical comparison for all salary ranges

### **Smart Result Ranking**
